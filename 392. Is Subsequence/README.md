[392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

level: Easy



Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


## Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"<br> 
t = "ahbgdc"<br>
Output: true


## Example 2:

Input: s = "axc"<br>
t = "ahbgdc"<br>
Output: false

## Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100<br>
0 <= t.length <= 104<br>
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
